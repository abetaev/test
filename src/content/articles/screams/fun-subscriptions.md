i just noticed email from amazon music from which i have unsubscribed 3 months ago because i have never actually subscribed for it, but rather was fooled into some kind of free subscription which transformed into paid without any notifications.

so i decided to check whether i am still subscribed. and (what the fuck?) i was subscribed! and paid $10/month for this shit for all of these 3 months.

to unsubscribe from it i had to confirm it thrice that i really so fuckin' want to cancel my bloody subscription for the fucks fuck...

amazon is becomming evil and showing its true fa<s>ith</s>ce
