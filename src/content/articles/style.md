# everything has its style

often we don't appreciate something just for what it is.

often we may have reasons not to.

but once in a while remembering something that have not been appreciated at the time gives us an opportunity to feel such appreciation today, and, i believe, to appreciate whatever has passed.

one of such things is the fact that there were lessons of history of the city in my class, which i have not really ever enjoyed, because they seem boring at the time and teacher wasn't interesting, but from which i also know few things, like few architectural styles such as barocco, rococo, classicism with few different variations and, of course, gothics, which were not so spread across the city, but unavoidable for the age.

and the knowledge about them along with the model of the world where culture is an entity attributed to everything that is made by it caused my mind to generate an interesting question: will we ever have a class which will study software architecture as in art styles rather than something technical?

# too much of explicit is excess.

to come up with a question there should be some logic involved, that logic is the rational, the reason to ask that question. one may argue saying that unconscious processes do not follow logic and rather chaotic. i don't like to argue.

unconscious also follows some logic, it, from a first glance, may not be so clear as logic of our conscious processes, but i don't tend to do a lot of analysis of conscious, rather tend to write it into "i have done it myself" memory slot to reinforce my belief in control over reality; and when i start paying attention to all that "conscious" my mind explodes under pressure of billions of details which suddenly appear instead of that glossy as plastic concept.

same is unconscious. it is, though, a little bit trickier, but the structure of common principle is the same. it is a neural network after all!

and if i can consciously come up with some options, it may be possible to figure out something that might help to find which one is the closest to *a* truth. it is a neural network after all...

i repeated these processes, conscious analysis and unconscious reasoning. i guess it is called self digging. it gave me a way to know myself, to understand.

and the answer is section's title.
