# Concept

Tool to output stuff into public.

## Why? (Motivation)

- Artistic expression
- Blow off steam

### why Public?

- Private already exists
- Observer effect
  - Experimentation

## Structure

- Display Content
  - Embeddings (audio, code, diagrams, pictures, video, ...)
  - Navigation
- Feedback (comments)

# Manifestation

Brief and Simple.

## Base

Web Application.

### Tools

#### Engine

[Astro](https://astro.build/):

- Satisfies most of my demands
- Provides flexibility to satisfy the rest
- Well aligned with contemporaneity principles

## Features

### Display Content

MDX format provides most of the features out of the box:
- Embedding pictures
- Embedding HTML parts

Some specific cases to be solved on occurrence.


#### Diagrams

Structured Information Representation is often the essential for delivery of an idea.

I often think while moving stuff around in a [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

Diagrams within website content should be text to graphics.


##### Options

###### Mermaid

[mermaid-js](https://mermaid.js.org/) has ready to use
[Astro integration](https://code.juliancataldo.com/component/astro-diagram)
Thanks to [Julian Cataldo](https://github.com/JulianCataldo).

Downsides:

- syntax and diagrams look chaotic
- there is very small subset of UML supported
- almost no control over layouts
- requires puppeteer (i.e. browser) to render text into SVG ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Alternative - Remark plugin:

- won't eliminate any downsides (mermaid has this complexity flow in its core)
- there is more than one options to research


###### Graphviz

Robust Versatile C library for Complex Graph Visualizations.

Issues with Color Scheme Preference: in dark mode text is hardly readable.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
```dot
digraph G {
  bgcolor="#0000FF44:#FF000044" gradientangle=90
	subgraph cluster_0 {
		style=filled;
		color=lightgrey;
		fillcolor="darkgray:gold";
		gradientangle=0
		node [fillcolor="yellow:green" style=filled gradientangle=270] a0;
		node [fillcolor="lightgreen:red"] a1;
		node [fillcolor="lightskyblue:darkcyan"] a2;
		node [fillcolor="cyan:lightslateblue"] a3;

    	a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3;
    	label = "process #1";
    }

    subgraph cluster_1 {
    	node [fillcolor="yellow:magenta"
    		 style=filled gradientangle=270] b0;
    	node [fillcolor="violet:darkcyan"] b1;
    	node [fillcolor="peachpuff:red"] b2;
    	node [fillcolor="mediumpurple:purple"] b3;

    	b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3;
    	label = "process #2";
    	color=blue
    	fillcolor="darkgray:gold";
    	gradientangle=0
    	style=filled;
    }
    start -> a0;
    start -> b0;
    a1 -> b3;
    b2 -> a3;
    a3 -> a0;
    a3 -> end;
    b3 -> end;

    start [shape=Mdiamond ,
    	fillcolor="pink:red",
    	gradientangle=90,
    	style=radial];
    end [shape=Msquare,
    	fillcolor="lightyellow:orange",
    	style=radial,
    	gradientangle=90];

}

```
In light mode this looks okay.

###### svgbob

Sweet stuff for dessert.

[svgbob](https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbob) is an ASCII graphics to SVG converter written
in Rust.

<details>
<summary>It is just amazing.</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>The integration of svgbob is almost same easy as graphviz</summary>
<Code
  lang="typescript"
  file="src/integrations/svgbob.ts"
/>
Thanks to kind people who created [svgbob WASM port](https://github.com/agoose77/svgbob-wasm) and [wrapper for it](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/bob-wasm/tree/master).

I have just removed style to fit SVG style into the website's style.

</details>


##### Summary

|              | mermaid  | graphviz | svgbob   |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| usage        | simple   | complex  | tedious  |
| integration  | complex  | simple   | simple   |
| flexibility  | fair     | extreme  | hackable |
| performance  | errgh?.. | fast     | fast     |
| designation  | frontend | backend  | backend  |
| productivity | high     | depends  | low      |

All three options can coexist providing their benefits when required.

However, I have not been completely satisfied by neither of them and feel an urge to
experiment with text to diagram myself. Hopefully I will find time.


#### Music (Bandcamp)

Cross origin policy should prevent some tracking.

<details>
<summary>The integration</summary>

<Code lang="typescript" file="src/components/Bandcamp.astro"/>

Killswitch is needed to keep console clear from CORS errors.

</details>


### Navigation (Preview)


#### Page Types

1. Article (is a Content Item)
2. List of Content Item Previews


#### Display Rules

* Each article has an Id to match with any bound resources (e.g. Discussion)
* If List Page contains single Item Preview, redirect to that Item instead of showing it


#### Preprocessing

<details>
<summary>Vite plugin to embed Ids and generate Previews.</summary>
<Code lang="typescript" file="src/integrations/vite.ts"/>
`src/content/config.ts` appears in Vite's `load` hook each time content changes.
</details>


### Feedback

Discussions bound to content.


#### Why?

- Rational:

  Feedback is important part of any system.

  If a system is not capable of receiving a feedback it is singular, i.e. does not have
  volume. Lack of volume makes it a "ghost": removes its ability to interact with
  environment.

- Irrational:

  I want to do it myself to have better control over the ways data handled.


#### How?

- Use Github discussions to persist data.

- Integrate with project:

  User and Repository from origin URL are part of configuration

#### Authentication

Microservice for [OAuth Code Grant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) flow

<details>
<summary>Alternative</summary>

[Github Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps):

- requires a bit more complicated backend
- allows fine-grained permissions settings => more secure
- non-standard (comparing to standardized OAuth2 framework)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Client-side Authentication</summary>

Discussions are `client:only`.

Github-harness is provided as &lt;Github/&gt; component. It follows semantics of
[Solid's &lt;Show/&gt;](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#show):

```jsx
<Github
  fallback={(LoginButton) => (
    /* render login UI here */
  )}
  {...clientConfiguration}
>
  {(client, LogoutButton) => (
    /* use client to fetch data for UI */
  )}
</Github>
```

- Access Token is only in memory of that component.
- If page is refreshed, token is gone.

<Code lang="tsx" file="src/components/Github.tsx" />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Server-side Authentication</summary>

1. Cloud function is [cost efficient for such tasks](https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing):

   Considering amount of expected visitors equal to zero, it should be free.

2. GCP Secret Manager is used to store Client Secret

   - Delegation is a profitable strategy when applied wisely‚òù

   - Storing small amount of secrets [is also almost free in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/pricing)

Prerequisites:

- [Create OAuth application on Github](https://github.com/settings/developers)

  - Set `github_client_secret` in GCP Secret Manager

    Secret Manager should contain `github_client_secret` with `latest` version value
    corresponding to the actual Client Secret provided by Github

  - Set `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` environment variable

- Service Account (by default - App Engine's default SA) which executes cloud
  function MUST have role "Secret Manager Secret Accessor"

  > **NOTE:** It should be possible to setup fine-grained rules for each role, but for me
  > it did not work for a specific secret name

- Set `BASE_URL` environment variable

  > **ATTENTION:** One may fail a part, but ought to chamfer it.
  > Same with security: don't neglect CORS, set exact URLs in policy headers.

<Code lang="go" file="auth/github-oauth2-handler.go" />

Why go? - It's the fastest available.

#### Github GraphQL Client

Inception: [Github's GraphQL Explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer).


##### Tools

- [@graphql-codegen/cli](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) to bind schema to code

- [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) to execute requests

<details>
<summary>Alternatives</summary>

- [@octokit/graphql](https://github.com/octokit/graphql.js/)

  does not bring any benefits comparing to standard [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)

  for shooting sparrows from a cannon

- [graphql-zeus](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-zeus)

  neat, but brings in vulnerabilities

###### TODO

- Live comments: use GraphQL subscriptions

- Transparent Title:

  - Human-Readable titles in Github discussions

  - Heuristics to match Content with Discussion

  - Transformers to update existing data

- Support Replies

### Fanciness

- [PicoCSS framework](https://picocss.com/) brings style to semantic markup.

- Minimal customizations for c9e

- PicoCSS may be fully replaced or adapted later; semantic markup will stay

#### Color Scheme Preference

- `default` is determined with media-query feature
  [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)

- [PicoCSS framework](https://picocss.com/) handles it out of the box

- Source code embeddings require separate implementation of color scheme preference

  Astro Default - [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) does not allow to handle runtime
