sounds of cars passing by were mixing with lounge music that played in open ear headphones while i was walking right onto car's lights hitting my eyes with their mostly xenon, therefore whitish and blinding, glow.

i turned the corner and the fading noise i have left behind mixed with more rough sound of post rock which came to replace the lounge track.
