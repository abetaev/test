Embedding diagrams into recursive article appeared to be pretty complex, and, while there seemed to be just one mermaid js, I just did not like it and was looking for a better way.

I needed something that is compatible with remark/markdown/mdx, while flexible enough to draw various stuff I want. Apparently there is not so much options for node, but there was that graphviz library with dot language support... and there was a plugin.

Which for the fucks fuck was licensed under GPLv3.

I may understand the intent under this license, but the fact that it enforces me to do something just explodes me into the worst anger. I do what I want. And no license can tell me what I cannot do.

I don't give a fuck about your rules, stupid people.
