after pretty heavy depressive episode i suddenly realized by analyzing contents of my freezer that i keep all my foes in it.

not that there is ones head chopped off or other body parts... it's more like ice cream and vodka. well, vodka will soon be gone, it's like 30ml of it, but ice cream is much, much more evil than vodka, as my that last depressive edpisode demonstrated...

i have a gallon of ice cream in there. i want it very much. but i may just die :)

some time ago i stored weed in my freezer. i don't anymore. does it mean we're allies now?
